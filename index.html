<h1>A Rural Family Farm</h1>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p><em>The below is not official statements backed by any data</em></p>
    <p>At present, family farming is a subject of great importance for sustainable development of rural communities and promotion of healthy lifestyle. According to FAO Policies, family farming is a means of organizing agricultural, forestry, fisheries, pastoral and aquaculture production which is managed and operated by a family and predominantly reliant on family labour, including both women's and men's. Family farming is the predominant form of agriculture in the food production sector for both in developing and developed countries</p>
    <p>The definition of family farm varies across countries and contexts. We reviewed 36 definitions and uses of the term “family farm” by academics, government and civil society organisations that describe the characteristics that make family farms unique. After reviewing these concepts we conclude that the majority of definitions recognize the role of family labour and the role of the family in managing the farm operation. However, the notion of family farming seems to go beyond farming capacity, si ze and orientation. The term is sometimes also used to capture ecological, social, cultural and environmental objectives and therefore has close ties to the local culture and the rural community.</p>
